# Project2, Sorting
For project2, you need to fill in the code of the following sorting methods in the SortingImplementaiton class:
-	Insertion sort
-	Iterative merge sort
-	Randomized Quick Sort
-	Hybrid sort (that uses both quicksort and insertion sort)
-	Bucket sort
-	External sort

Each method is described in detail in the pdf description of the project posted on Canvas.
